    <h1><em>performances</em></h1>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Nomi</h2>
    <p>Nomi is a theatrical work inspired by the life, aesthetic, and cultural impact of Klaus Sperber, aka Klaus Nomi. I constructed the script and worked with Riley Fox Hillyer to stage it for Theatre on Fire's Cabinet of Curiosities festival. It was performed at the Charlestown Working Theatre in May 2017.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Cabaret Das</h2>
  <p>An hour of some performance pieces devised from text, music, and fears.</p>

<p>Performed at the Huret and Spector Gallery on Emerson's campus in September 2017. Watch the video (created from documentation) for context, and an introduction to what <em> das </em> is. The name was a riff on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret_Voltaire_(Zurich)" target="_blank">Dada's Cabaret Voltaire </a> and our goal was to just make something...from nothing. This was the first performance exploring the "das" aesthetic</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Das Classroom</h2>
<img width="400" src="../assets/dasClassroom.jpg" class="float-left" />
<p>The second "das" performance, seeking to place "das" in the academic-aesthetic historical-discourse via a performance art lecture. This 3 hour TED talk-esq experiment was performed at Emerson College. It featured improvisational devising exercises, lip-syncing, reclamation of play-submission-feedback, sound collages, John Cage-ian boredom, a history of Das' origin, and more.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Das Art</h2>
  <img width="300" src="../assets/dasArt.jpg" class="right-content" />
  <p>Subverting the form of gallery spaces (inspired by theories from <em>Inside the White Cube: The Ideology of the Gallery Space</em> by Brian O'Doherty), this piece blurs spectactor/performer roles by handing each visitor a proxy through which they look at the artworks (ranging from photo to painting to video to performance art) and communicate with one another. I started this piece as a project for my "Studio for Interrelated Media Practice" class at MassArt. I'm excited by the possibility of producing it in literally any availible space.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">textiles</h2>
  <p>an art piece about textile waste (<a href="https://glitch.com/~textiles" target="_blank">in progress</a>).</p>

  <h1><em>wikipedia</em></h1>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">edit-a-thons</h2>
  <p>With HowlRound, I've helped facilitate Wikipedia edit-a-thons, where a group of people get together and edit articles around a certain topic. One, in partnership with the New England New Play Alliance was quite successful in improving articles related to New England theatres and artists. It makes me so proud to see people invested in Wikipedia.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">independent writing</h2>
  <p>My first Wikipedia article was Branden Jacobs-Jenkins' <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Octoroon">An Octoroon</a></em>, written in place of a final essay for a theatre history course. I continue to write on Wikipedia because I'm privileged with an education and knowledge of this topic, and Wikipedia is so wildly popular that I think it's important for historically unrecognized artists to be written about with as much detail and recognition as those in "the cannon".</p>
