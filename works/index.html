    <h1><em>performanceworks</em></h1>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Das Classroom</h2>
  <p>A 3 hour performance-art-lecture exploring this aesthetic I call das. I performed this on February 23rd, 2018 in the Walker building at Emerson College.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Cabaret Das</h2>
  <p>An hour of some performance pieces devised from text, music, and fears.</p>

<p>Performed at the Huret and Spector Gallery on Emerson's campus in September 2017. Watch the video (created from documentation) for context, and an introduction to what <em> das </em> is. The name was a riff on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret_Voltaire_(Zurich)" target="_blank">Dada's Cabaret Voltaire </a> and our goal was to just make something...from nothing.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Nomi</h2>
  <p>Nomi is a theatrical work inspired by the life, aesthetic, and cultural impact of Klaus Sperber, aka Klaus Nomi. I constructed the script and worked with Riley Fox Hillyer to stage it for Theatre on Fire's Cabinet of Curiosities festival. It was performed at the Charlestown Working Theatre in May 2017.</p>

  <h1 style="text-align:right"><em>wikipedia</em></h1>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">edit-a-thons</h2>
  <p>With HowlRound, I've helped fasciliate Wikipedia edit-a-thons, where a group of people get together and edit articles around a certain topic. One, in partnership with the New England New Play Alliance was quite successful in improving articles related to New England theatres and artists. It makes me so proud to see people invested in Wikipedia.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">independent writing</h2>
  <p>My first Wikipedia article was Branden Jacobs-Jenkins' <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Octoroon">An Octoroon</a></em>, written in place of a final essay for a theatre history course. I continue to write on Wikipedia because I'm privileged with an education and knowledge of this topic, and Wikipedia is so wildly popular that I think it's important for historically unrecognized artists to be written about with as much detail and recognition as those in "the cannon".</p>
