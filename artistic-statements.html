    <h1>my most current artistic statement</h1>
  </header>

<p class="teeny">
  <b>tldr:</b> I'm drawn towards authentic failure, wild experimentation, remixing, and making people laugh. Most of my art is rooted in performance, as I play with other mediums: painting, collage, puppetry, dance, stand-up, whatever seems like fun! </p>

<p>
I've found that I'm constantly changing my mind about who I am.
I often have revelations about myself, then forget them...then rediscover something or remember another thing.

I’m drawn to making a lot of different things. I act. I write computer code. I paint. I'm trying to make sculptures like Bob Rauschenberg...I compile monthly analytic data. I dance. I am always learning and trying a great deal of things. Some things I'm quite skilled at; other things I do because I enjoy the trying e.g. playing the piano — I am not skilled at playing the piano but I've been practicing playing it and improvising with it and having fun. I’m trying to manifest the future I want to see in the world: more resource sharing for historically oppressed populations, and less pain because of one’s identity. Making art is a good way for me to activate people's empathy and form a community around an experience. I'm learning computer programming so I can make things that can help people, whether it's bringing them new information or assisting them with something.

When I make art I am thinking about how to craft:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Comedy</li>
<li>Spectacle</li>
<li>Musicality</li>
</ul>

<p>
I’m really comfortable stealing from artists right now, cause I’m figuring out who I am. Of course attributing is important.

Taylor Mac’s mantra “perfection is for assholes” is big for me right now.

<p>
Theatre director JoAne Akalaitis said that chaos is the source of drama, not conflict.
I take that literally as I do a lot of things. I’m a theatre person (if you call yourself a theatre person does that mean you won’t be seen as a visual artist or a sound artist or anything else?). Further, I enjoy the elements Akalaitis identifies: the illogical, the disruptive, the disturbing, and the reckless. Visually, I like messes. I like the juxtaposition of things that surprisingly go together. I have always been intimidated by visual art. But I’m pushing myself to be uncomfortable and try things, and forget the standards I agreed to at some point.

Attached is a sketch I made on Evernote showing the difference between chaos and conflict.
