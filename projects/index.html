    <h1><em>das</em></h1>

    <p>
      I use the word das to describe my aesthetic. It's a sort of matrix.
    </p>
    <p id="equation">
      "Is this das?" ~~~ "That is not das" ~~~ "Oh this is so das"
    </p>
    <p>
      During the fall of 2016, my colleagues at HowlRound were describing the theatre they saw in Eastern Europe as "das"... and I mistook it for some sort of academically cannonized word. So now that's the prefix I've given to different projects. I love using it to be simultaneously pretencious (I am making Das Theatre—The Theatre!) but also not serious at all...
    </p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Cabaret Das</h2>

  <p>To launch das Riley Fox Hillyer and I created Cabaret Das. The name and form is homage to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret_Voltaire_(Zurich)" target="_blank">Dada Cabaret Voltaire</a>. We devised short performances from text, music, and fears. From that documentation I created the above video. We performed Cabaret Das at the Huret and Spector Gallery on Emerson's campus in September 2017.

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Das Classroom</h2>

    <p>The second das performance really saught to place "das" in the academic-aesthetic historical-discourse via a performance art lecture. This 3 hour TED talk-esq experiment was performed at Emerson College. It featured improvisational devising exercises, lip-syncing, reclamation of play-submission-feedback, sound collages, John Cage-ian boredom, a history of Das' origin, and more. Through this performance I began to realize that das is a reach towards the avant-garde independent European artists I love, but firmly planted in the history and path I have been on as an American.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Das Art</h2>
    <img width="300" src="../assets/dasArt.jpg" class="right-content" />
    <p>Subverting the form of gallery spaces (inspired by theories from <em>Inside the White Cube: The Ideology of the Gallery Space</em> by Brian O'Doherty), this piece blurs spectactor/performer roles by handing each visitor a proxy through which they look at the artworks (ranging from photo to painting to video to performance art) and communicate with one another. I started this piece as a project for my "Studio for Interrelated Media Practice" class at MassArt. I'm excited by the possibility of producing it in literally any availible space.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Das Party</h2>
    <img width="300" src="../assets/dasParty.jpg" class="float-left" />
    <p>A literal pity party. Different stations are set up for people to visit in order to exorcise pity & fear. Disappointments from life are collected before the audience's arrival, and written on the party hats.</p>
    <p>The stations include: "Pin the tail on the map where you've cried", "Spin the bottle, but instead of kissing someone, look into their eyes for 47 seconds", "Draw a photo of an ex you never want to see again (but blindfolded)", and the "Area to just be on your phone and not talk to anyone"</p>
    <p>Like Das Art, this is a modular/versitile work that can fit into any space. </p>

    <h1><em>Nomi</em></h1>
    <p>Nomi is a theatrical work inspired by the life, aesthetic, and cultural impact of Klaus Sperber, aka Klaus Nomi. I constructed the script and worked with Riley Fox Hillyer to stage it for Theatre on Fire's Cabinet of Curiosities festival. It was performed at the Charlestown Working Theatre in May 2017.</p>

  <h1 style="text-align:right;"><em>explorations in scripting</em></h1>
  <p>On the website <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a> I've been experimenting with using websites as a form for performance-scripts, rather than using Microsoft Word or Google Docs. I think about how playscripts have looked the same for so long (character names in all caps, stage directions italicised, etc) & how that has shaped the imagination of artists.</p>
  <p>Bewildered & in love with devised/experimental groups, I wonder what is the best way to embed the collaborative process, source material, and dramaturgy into a single document. Rather than writing "Four Seasons by Vivaldi plays" in the script, can't I just embed that sound? Can I embed videos, GIFs, emoji, etc rather than having to translate every idea into words?</p>
  <p>Ideas for different pieces and scripts and experiments/experiences can be viewed <a href="https://glitch.com/@travisamiel" target="_blank">on my Glitch page</a>.

  <h1><em>wikipedia</em></h1>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">edit-a-thons</h2>
  <p>With HowlRound I've helped facilitate Wikipedia edit-a-thons, where a group of people get together and edit articles around a certain topic. One, in partnership with the New England New Play Alliance was quite successful in improving articles related to New England theatres and artists. It makes me so proud to see people invested in Wikipedia.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">independent writing</h2>
  <p>My first Wikipedia article was Branden Jacobs-Jenkins' <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Octoroon">An Octoroon</a></em>, written in place of a final essay for a theatre history course. I continue to write on Wikipedia because I'm privileged with an education and knowledge of this topic, and Wikipedia is so wildly popular that I think it's important for historically unrecognized artists to be written about with as much detail and recognition as those in "the cannon".</p>
